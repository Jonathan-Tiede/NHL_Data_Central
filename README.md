## Goals


## General Notes
A goal of this project, beyond the above-stated, is to adhere more closely to best practices for GitHub projects. This is the first time I am making this a focus and so it won't be perfect, but here it goes. Some of the focal points will be:
- Specific Conda environment for this project (will create a Requirements.txt file)
- Separate actively used folders for src, doc, dep, etc.
- Up-to-date changelog
- Git best practices (branching, atomic commits, etc.)
